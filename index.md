### Functional Genomics and Evolutionary Ecology Group

<br/>

Welcome to GxE Lab. We study the function and evolution of cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulatory factors involved in gene expression regulation, and the role of gene expression variation in genome evolution and environmental adaption.

If you are interested in joining the group as a master/PhD student or postdoctoral fellow, please do not hesitate to contact Us (hong_zhang@lzu.edu.cn).

We also have some projects for undergraduate students. Please contact the PI directly if you want to carry out your graduation project in our group. 

A note on the abbreviation of our group name: "GxE" stands for the intersection between Functional <ins>G</ins>enomics and <ins>E</ins>volution/<ins>E</ins>cology. You can also think of "Gene-Environment interaction".
